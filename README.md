Migaloo Chain is the home of the White Whale.

This chain began as a fork of wasmd, and is an exploration into better CosmWasm enabled chain templates that more
rigorously follow upstream standards. It began as the wasmd repository, and we're hoping that it will end up as a
feather/ignite/whatever template.

We kept the git history, because that's the way :).
