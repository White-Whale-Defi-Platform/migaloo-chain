# Code of Conduct

Migaloo has an open, friendly, diverse, and welcoming community. We accept and respect everybody equally, but we
don't tolerate harassing, trolling, or spamming. We are here to build, not to engage in toxic behavior.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the community a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity
and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion,
or sexual identity and orientation.

All Migaloo contributors are required to be respectful towards other members of the team and the community. We expect
everybody to act in the best interest of the community.

## Conflict resolution

Contributors and community members should always try to solve conflicts communicatively. We encourage everybody to use
appropriate communication channels to express their concerns and feelings. These channels include on-chain governance and
social media platforms like Twitter and Discord. Always remember to focus on what is best for the community.

TLDR
Be good.
